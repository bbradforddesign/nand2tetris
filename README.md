# nand2tetris
Projects completed as part of the nand2tetris course

## Summary
The goal of these projects is to build a fully-functional 16-bit computer platform from the ground up, from designing the hardware using logic gates, all the way to finally developing an operating system.

The project is built using a group of domain-specific languages, including an HDL, an assembly language called Hack, and a high-level object-oriented language based on Java, called Jack. 

For the software portions, I've also chosen to implement the computer's assembler, virtual machine, and compiler using JavaScript running within Node.js.
